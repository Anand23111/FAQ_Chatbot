Appreciation Post and Improvement Suggestions,"['Jupiter has  wonderful customer service support and its a pleasure to interact with them even though the more less we use it, the more the better(the app is more stable and the issues are sorted without need to approach), but you know that you can rely on them when in need. Kudos to@Jitenand his team for improving the customer experience.Now for some suggestions to further improve the customer support experience-1)Please mail the transcript of the communication exchange to the customer on his email as well, that will help him to keep track and remember as well incase he clear his notifications.2)Do also include  displaying a message like typing… or some symbol when either the support staff or the customer is typing.I hope to see these changes implemented soon as this will not just enhance an already beautiful experience but also will be more intuitive to the final consumer and  will in the process keep him alert and patient as well. Well done once again.@sneh.baxi@sahil-sorathiya', ""Thanks@cric_freak! We love talking to our customers tooMessages like these keep us going.Also, thanks a bunch for the suggestions!Mailing the transcript / Having a record of the ticket or issue - Very legit ask.

Account and Funds Accessibility Issues in Pots,"['Dear Jupiter App Product ManagersOn 15th April, I created financial pots within The Jupiter App and deposited an amount of money into it, assuming full functionality as my account was active at the time. However, upon attempting to close this pot and withdraw my funds, I was informed by the customer service team that my account had unexpectedly become “Dormant”. I was further advised that reactivation of my account requires a physical visit to the nearest branch of Federal Bank Ltd to complete KYC verification procedures.This requirement is inconvenient, as the initial account setup and KYC were conducted online. The sudden necessity for an in-person visit, which contradicts the digital-first convenience promised by The Jupiter App, is not only frustrating but also impractical, given the current emphasis on digital solutions.Moreover, the explanation provided—that the creation of the pot triggered the dormancy of my account—seems highly irregular and lacks transparency. This situation has led to my money being unjustly stuck without proper justification or prior warning.Therefore, I request a thorough investigation into this matter and ask for the following actions to be taken:A clear explanation of why my account was marked dormant after the pot creation and how it allowed me to deposit money in a “Dormant” account.Immediate restoration of online KYC procedures to reactivate my account, ensuring access to my funds without unnecessary hurdles.Assurance of better customer support in handling such issues, preventing future occurrences for myself and other users.Please consider this matter with urgency, as it affects not only the accessibility of my funds but also the trust placed in The Jupiter App. I would appreciate a prompt response, detailing the steps you will take to resolve this issue.Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.']",[],Bug hunters,account funds accessibility issues pots,dear jupiter app product managerson 15th april created financial pots within jupiter app deposited amount money assuming full functionality account active time however upon attempting close pot withdraw funds informed customer service team account unexpectedly become dormant advised reactivation account requires physical visit nearest branch federal bank ltd complete kyc verification proceduresthis requirement inconvenient initial account setup kyc conducted online sudden necessity inperson visit contradicts digitalfirst convenience promised jupiter app frustrating also impractical given current emphasis digital solutionsmoreover explanation providedthat creation pot triggered dormancy accountseems highly irregular lacks transparency situation led money unjustly stuck without proper justification prior warningtherefore request thorough investigation matter ask following actions takena clear explanation account marked dormant pot creation allowed deposit money dormant accountimmediate restoration online kyc procedures reactivate account ensuring access funds without unnecessary hurdlesassurance better customer support handling issues preventing future occurrences usersplease consider matter urgency affects accessibility funds also trust placed jupiter app would appreciate prompt response detailing steps take resolve issuethank attention urgent matter

Issue with Changing Phone Number on Jupiter App,"['I am writing to bring to your attention an issue I am currently facing with changing my phone number on the Jupiter app.When attempting to update my phone number, the app indicates that my desired number is already associated with another account. I suspect this may be the same number I tried to use when initially creating my account. Unfortunately, at that time, I encountered difficulties with Aadhar verification, preventing the successful creation of the account.Since then, I have successfully created an account using a different phone number.Previously, I had initiated the account opening process using a phone number that I could not complete due to Aadhar verification issues. Consequently, that previous account remains incomplete and half-baked.Now, as I am trying to switch my currently opened account’s phone number to that previous phone number which is linked with my bank accounts and Aadhaar card, the app indicates that my desired number is already associated with the incomplete KYC account which I did not open yet and now not even allowing me to proceed with the further with that account also.Could you kindly guide me on how to delete or resolve the half-baked account associated with my previous phone number?Your prompt assistance in addressing this matter would be highly appreciated.

Loan Errors: Navigating a Financial Maze: Challenges Faced with Flipkart's EMI and IDFC First Bank. Are they scamming us?,"['Hello All!!On 8th October 2023, I made a purchase of an MSI Core i3 11th Gen laptop through Flipkart and opted for the “Flipkart Pay Later EMI” service with IDFC First Bank as the lending partner, which was loan 1. Additionally, on 11th October 2023, I purchased a TWS in EMI of 1750 for 3 months, making the total cost to be paid 4999 along with a loan processing fee of 116, which was loan 2.As per the terms of loan 1, I was supposed to pay a total amount of 26597 in 6 installments of 4749, along with a loan processing fee of 471. However, I decided to prepay the entire outstanding loan amount of loan 1 on 18th October 2023, with a foreclosure fee of 1063.88, resulting in a total payment of 27891.45 made to IDFC First Bank before the billing date of EMIs of 1 November 2023.If I had not opted for foreclosure of loan 1, then my total EMI would have been 7086 for the first month, which includes the EMIs & processing fees of both loan 1 and loan 2 and 6499 for the subsequent months. Once the EMIs of loan 2 were completed, I would have had to pay 4749. However, since I have already paid the entire loan amount of loan 1, I did not need to pay anything for loan 1.Therefore, my current EMI should be 1816 for the 1st month, which includes only the EMI of loan 2 and the loan processing fee of 116, and 1750 for the subsequent months.However, I am facing an issue where the EMI amount of 8151.88 appeared in my statement for November 2023, generated on 2nd November 2023, despite the prepayment and the issuance of a No Dues Certificate by IDFC First Bank confirming the clearance of all dues of loan 1. They also added the foreclosure amount to my statement, which I had already paid.This discrepancy is causing confusion and inconvenience as the EMI amount should not be reflected in my statement after the full prepayment. I am concerned that I might be charged for a payment I have already settled.Additionally, my Pay Later account has been suspended by Flipkart due to non-payment, as stated in an SMS from Flipkart, not the bank.However, I have made the EMI payment for the loan through the bank’s app, along with the loan processing fees for both accounts.On 2 November, I reached out to the customer support teams of both Flipkart and IDFC First Bank. The bank informed me that they have closed the loan account on their end and provided me with a No Dues Certificate. However, when I contacted Flipkart, they advised me to contact the bank, even though I had already done so and the bank had cleared their name from the issue this goes on at least 10 times in 1 day. The problem lies with Flipkart, as they have not processed the amount from their side and it still appears on my statement. I have already gone through two stages of complaint, first with customer care and then with the grievance officer, providing all the necessary evidence. Unfortunately, no resolution has been reached thus far.Now, I am considering escalating my complaint to the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) via the RBI Ombudsman. I am requesting the RBI to rectify this error and provide compensation for the mental distress I have experienced.Please advise me on the next steps I should take, or if you have any other suggestions, kindly let me know.', 'Welcome to the community@umarlipkart’s PayLater and PayLater EMI features tend to confuse everyone.

Need some clarifications on the updates,"['I signed up for Jupiter a while ago but was not able to use it properly, because I switched phone and kept getting the “rooted phone” errors for a long time, which made it impossible to access the Jupiter account because there is no web app for it (which is a very bad idea, or is there a web app that I don’t know of?).I was finally able to log into the app properly today and I see that I need to maintain an NRV of Rs. 10,000 to get rewards (at another point it says I need a salary account).

So after logging in I found out that I had not been getting rewards at all. I have no idea when this was put into place.Not just that, there is now a rs. 199 charge for debit card, and rewards are limited to salary account.

Need to update my phone number,"['I have reached you guys many times via call and email regarding my issue. Now that I know one thing that there is no way for you guys to identify an account holder other than using his phone number which questions on why I should trust my pot funds to someone who doesn’t have a proper way to authenticate a customer even when biometrics and video verifications and lots are available.I had got my phone stolen on Dec 13 and along with it, I lost my sim which was registered under my sister’s name and she is abroad right now. So I couldn’t get a duplicate of it. I went to the nearest federal Bank and updated my phone number over there and I had filled the email address registered on the form. They said I’d get access to Jupiter in 24hrs. Now that I am trying to login to my Jupiter, it shows a message that “the email is address is registered to another number (old number)”. I reached out to your customer support via call and chat number of times which I found to be a complete waste of time and energy. I had no issue with updating phone number at Kotak Mahindra which is my salary account. Why do you guys have no way of verifying an existing user other than phone number? I even got my Pan card and aadhar updated while you guys still have trouble sorting my issue out. Not even a ticket numbe was raised even after reaching out so many times. How can I trust someone like you when I have my savings pot stuck inside it? Is there no way for your system to authenticate an existing customer other than using phone number?

And that’s why they may have designed their systems and processes around the mobile number verification.

They asked me to buy the products and review them, promising that the product amount and a commission would be added to my account.They continued to add high-value products, and during that time, I was not thinking clearly and ended up giving around ₹615,800. They then increased the product value to ₹1.3 million and asked me to complete the task to withdraw the money, which I couldn’t do.The scammers used the name of a known e-commerce company, OnBuy (an England-based company), to deceive people. When I realized I had been scammed, I immediately contacted the OnBuy social media team, who confirmed that it was a fake website and assured me they would report it.Without informing the scammers that I was aware of the scam, I immediately filed a complaint with my bank and the cybercrime department and also visited my bank branch. The bank’s assistant manager confirmed that the scammers’ accounts were frozen and that the money was still there.Despite this, I received no positive response from the bank for a chargeback. I escalated the matter to the RBI, but their team showed little interest in resolving the issue and focused only on closing the ticket.I have emailed the bank’s CEO, but their senior management keeps telling me to follow up with the cybercrime team and that they will only proceed once they receive an update from them. Since then, I have been continuously following up with the cybercrime team, but the person handling my case often claims to be busy and is now not even responding.The RBI states that any scam reported to the bank within 24-48 hours will result in a refund, but I believe this is false because no one is helping, and I am still paying EMIs on the amount I borrowed.I don’t know how or when I will get my money back. If anyone knows a way to resolve this, please suggest a solution that does not require any additional money, as I have exhausted all my savings.I live with my parents in a rented house, and my salary is not sufficient.
